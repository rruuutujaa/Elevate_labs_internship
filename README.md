Java Console Calculator - Internship Task 1
📋 Task Overview
This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the Java Developer Internship program. The objective was to build a basic calculator using Java console I/O that demonstrates fundamental programming concepts.

🎯 Objective
Build a basic calculator using Java console I/O that can perform arithmetic operations with proper error handling and user interaction.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Language: Java
IDE: Any Java-compatible IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
Runtime: Java Development Kit (JDK)
Terminal/Command Prompt for execution

✨ Features Implemented
Core Functionality
✅ Addition - Adds two numbers
✅ Subtraction - Subtracts second number from first
✅ Multiplication - Multiplies two numbers
✅ Division - Divides first number by second with error handling
Technical Features
✅ Method-based architecture - Separate methods for each operation
✅ Scanner input handling - Safe user input with validation
✅ Continuous operation loop - Allows multiple calculations
✅ Error handling - Handles division by zero and invalid inputs
✅ User-friendly interface - Clear menu and prompts
🚀 How to Run
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed
Command line/terminal access
Steps
Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-console-calculator.git
cd java-console-calculator
Compile the Java file
bash
javac src/ConsoleCalculator.java
Run the program
bash
java -cp src ConsoleCalculator
Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations
💡 Usage Examples
Basic Operations
=== Java Console Calculator ===
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit
Choose an operation (1-5): 1
Enter first number: 15.5
Enter second number: 10.3
Result: 15.50 + 10.30 = 25.80
Error Handling
Choose an operation (1-5): 4
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
Object-Oriented Programming
Class structure with proper encapsulation
Method organization for different functionalities
Constructor usage for initialization
Java Fundamentals
Scanner class for user input
Data types (double, int, boolean, String)
Control structures (loops, conditionals, switch statements)
Exception handling for robust error management
Best Practices
Input validation to prevent crashes
Clear method naming for readability
Proper resource management (Scanner closing)
User experience considerations
🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I demonstrated understanding of:

Java syntax and basic programming constructs
Console I/O operations using Scanner
Method creation and organization
Error handling techniques
Loop structures for continuous operation
User interface design principles

📝 Notes
The program uses double data type for decimal number support
Input validation prevents common user errors
Division by zero is handled gracefully without program termination
The calculator continues running until user chooses to exit
