🚀 Java Developer Internship - Elevate Labs
Complete solutions for Task 1 and Task 2 of the Java Developer Internship program.

🧮 Task 1: Java Console Calculator
Built a fully functional calculator using Java console I/O with continuous operation capability.

What I Built
Basic arithmetic operations - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
Method-based architecture - Separate methods for each operation
Continuous loop system - Perform multiple calculations without restarting
Error handling - Division by zero protection and invalid input management
Clean user interface - Numbered menu with clear prompts
Sample Output
=== Java Console Calculator ===
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit

Choose an operation (1-5): 1
Enter first number: 15.5
Enter second number: 10.3
Result: 15.50 + 10.30 = 25.80
🎓 Task 2: Student Record Management System
Created a comprehensive CLI-based CRUD application for managing student records with advanced features.

What I Built
Complete CRUD operations - Add, View, Update, Delete student records
Search functionality - Find students by name with partial matching
Sorting system - Sort students by marks (highest to lowest)
Statistics dashboard - View average marks, top student, and analytics
Data validation - Input validation for names (non-empty) and marks (0-100)
Professional interface - Formatted tables, confirmation dialogs, and user-friendly menus
Sample Interface
==================================================
                    MAIN MENU
==================================================
1. 📝 Add New Student
2. 👀 View All Students
3. ✏️ Update Student Record
4. 🗑️ Delete Student Record
5. 🔍 Search Student by Name
6. 📊 Sort Students by Marks
7. 📈 Show Statistics
8. 🚪 Exit
==================================================
Technical Implementation
Student Class with encapsulated fields (ID, name, marks)
ArrayList for dynamic data storage
Auto-incrementing ID system using static variables
Exception handling for robust error management
Collections framework for sorting operations
